# Task Manager Coding Challenge

## Overview

Create a task manager application with a RESTful API and a modern Angular frontend. The application should allow users to view a list of tasks and view individual task details.

## Time Limit

30 minutes

## Requirements

### Backend (.NET)

- Implement RESTful API endpoints for:
  - Getting a list of tasks
  - Getting a specific task by ID
- Ensure the API follows REST best practices
- The API should be production-ready and performant

### Frontend (Angular)

- Create two components:
  - Task List: Display a list of all tasks
  - Task Detail: Show detailed information for a specific task
- The application should be production-ready and performant
- A clean / responsive UI is not necessary (but gets bonus points)

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and organization
- API design and implementation
- Frontend architecture and implementation
- Performance considerations
- Production readiness

## Bonus Points

Extra points will be awarded for:

- Implementing rate limitations
- Displaying due dates in a user-friendly format
- Providing clear and concise documentation in the README about your approach and architectural decisions

## Getting Started

1. The backend is set up with a mock service containing sample tasks
2. The frontend is initialized with Angular CLI
3. Once done, make sure eveyrthing is available on GitHub

## Notes

- Consider this a production application that will be used by many users
- Focus on creating a maintainable and scalable solution
- All code is your code when submitted, change what is necessary
- Use modern development practices and patterns
- The solution should be ready for deployment

Good luck!
